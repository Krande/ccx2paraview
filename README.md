# Calculix to Paraview converter (frd to vtk/vtu)

Converts [CalculiX](http://www.dhondt.de/) .frd-file to view and postprocess calculation results in [Paraview](https://www.paraview.org/). For each output interval generates separate file - it makes possible to animate time history. Generates Mises and Principal components for stress and strain tensors.

# Download

Download Linux and Windows binaries from the [releases page](./releases). Binaries don't need to be installed.

<br/><br/>



# How to use

You'll need [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) with *numpy* to use this converter:

    pip3 install numpy

The main script is [ccx2paraview.py](ccx2paraview.py). Also you'll need:
- [frd2vtk.py](frd2vtk.py)
- [FRDParser.py](FRDParser.py)
- [VTKWriter.py](VTKWriter.py)
- [VTUWriter.py](VTUWriter.py)

It is recommended to convert .frd to modern XML .vtu format:

    python3 ccx2paraview.py jobname.frd vtu

To convert .frd to legacy ASCII .vtk format, use command:

    python3 ccx2paraview.py jobname.frd vtk

Unfortunately, VTK format doesn't support names for field components. So, for stress and strain tensors components will be numbered as:

    0. xx
    1. yy
    2. zz
    3. xy
    4. yz
    5. zx
    6. Mises
    7. Min Principal
    8. Mid Principal
    9. Max Principal

# Your help

Please, you may:

- Simply use this software and ask questions.
- Share your models and screenshots.
- Report problems by [posting issues](./issues).
- Follow discussion in the [Yahoo CalculiX Group](https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/CALCULIX/conversations/topics/13712)

# For developers

Converter is tested for all Caclulix examples. Folder [tests](./tests/) contains tests results. Each test contains .inp-task + .frd-calculation + .vtk and .vtu convertion results.

- *./tests/elements* contains tests of mesh conversion
- *./tests/examples* - models are taken directly from [Calculix examples](http://www.dhondt.de/ccx_2.15.test.tar.bz2)
- *./tests/users* contains files sent by users


Create binary with [pyinstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/) (both in Linux and in Windows):

    pip3 install pyinstaller
    pyinstaller ccx2paraview.py --onefile
