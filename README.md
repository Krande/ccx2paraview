# Calculix to Paraview converter (frd to vtk/vtu)

Converts [CalculiX](http://www.dhondt.de/) .frd-file to view and postprocess calculation results in [Paraview](https://www.paraview.org/). For each output interval generates separate file - it makes possible to animate time history. Generates Mises and Principal components for stress and strain tensors.

<br/><br/>



# How to use

You'll need [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) with *numpy* to use this converter:

    pip3 install numpy

The main script is [ccx2paraview.py](ccx2paraview.py). Also you'll need:
- [frd2vtk.py](frd2vtk.py)
- [FRDParser.py](FRDParser.py)
- [VTKWriter.py](VTKWriter.py)
- [VTUWriter.py](VTUWriter.py)

It is recommended to convert .frd to modern XML .vtu format:

    python3 ccx2paraview.py -frd jobname

To convert .frd to legacy ASCII .vtk format, use command:

    python3 ccx2paraview.py -frd jobname -fmt vtk

By default script will skip ERROR fields generated by CalculiX. If you'd like to leave them, run commands with '-skip 0' argument:

    python3 ccx2paraview.py -frd jobname -fmt vtk -skip 0
    python3 ccx2paraview.py -frd jobname -fmt vtu -skip 0

Unfortunately, VTK format doesn't support names for field components. So, for stress and strain tensors components will be numbered as:

    0. xx
    1. yy
    2. zz
    3. xy
    4. yz
    5. zx
    6. Mises
    7. Min Principal
    8. Mid Principal
    9. Max Principal

Folder [dev](./dev/) contains test results and development version of the converter - users may not need it.

Tested for [all Caclulix examples](./dev/tests-examples/).
